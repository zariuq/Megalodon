A version of the file 100thms_12.mg using ATPs is here as 100thms_12_h.mg.
It can be checked (without calling ATPs for the "aby" proofs) as follows:

megalodon 100thms_12_h.mg

There are 3401 proofs that claim to be done by the "aby" tactic.
Creating ATP problem files corresponding to the "aby" calls can be done as follows:

megalodon -createhammerprobs hammer 100thms_12_h.mg

This will create 3401 th0 files with names

hammer.<lineno>.<charno>.th0.p

and 1618 fof files with names

hammer.<lineno>.<charno>.fof.p

Every "aby" call generates a th0 file, but only those with a
first-order conclusion and first-order dependencies yield an fof file.
The "aby" call can be justified by having a higher-order ATP
prove the th0 file or having a first-order ATP prove the fof file.

In practice these 3401 goals can be justified by one of the following calls (in order of success):

Vampire called as follows:
vampire_rel_static_forIsabelle_6878 --input-syntax tptp --mode portfolio --schedule snake_slh -t 60 <th0file>

Vampire called as follows:
vampire_rel_static_forIsabelle_6878 --input-syntax tptp --mode portfolio --schedule snake_tptp_hol -t 60 <th0file>

Zipperposition ? called as follows:
run_portfolio_coop <th0file> 60 1 ../tmp

E (3.1.0-ho) called as follows:
eprover-ho -s --auto-schedule --cpu-limit=60 <th0file>

Lash (1.14) called as follows:
lash -t 60 <th0file>

Vampire (a version from from Jan 2025) called as follows:
vampire -t 60 --mode portfolio --cores 1 <foffile>

Note that ATPs are sometimes nondeterministic, so one may need to call the ATP multiple
times before obtaining a success. In practice we have found that these 14 th0 files
may require multiple calls to Vampire before success is reported.

In tests, for each of these 14 files at least one of a hundred calls like

vampire_rel_static_forIsabelle_6878 --input-syntax tptp --mode portfolio --schedule snake_slh -t 60 <th0file>

or

vampire_rel_static_forIsabelle_6878 --input-syntax tptp --mode portfolio --schedule snake_tptp_hol -t 60 <th0file>

should report success.

The curious reader can inspect the lines for these "aby" calls in 100thms_12_h.mg.

The file ATPresults2025 lasts all the hammer files (leaving * for [th0|fof]) and which ATPs solved them.
